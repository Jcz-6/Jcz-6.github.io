Welcome to our second blog entry for the development of Saving Animals by Josh and Jakub.

`Jakub`

The second week was quite slow as I was still trying to get my head around the full stack we will be using. I started focusing on the frontend by doing research into different frameworks, some options were Node, React and Svelt. Node was quickly rules out as its quite outdated and requires a lot of files to operate: a `single page` application would be better. Svelte seemed like the better option but we would have to learn it from scratch, we decided to go with React as we know a decent bit about how it works. This will give us a lot more time for our other moving parts.

As we have done React JS applications before we already knew where to start, we quickly developed a basic app and started testing some of our API endpoints but we wanted to do things a little different, instead of using `Fetch` for our calls we decided on using `Axios` as it delivers widespread browser support (especially older ones) due to the fact its based on XMLHttpRequest, on top of that it has automatic Json data transformation.

Another thing that also changed is the way React is ran, as Create React App is no longer a thing since 2023, leaving us with a choice of toolchains available and we chose Vite as its well documented and efficient and it allows support for pure Java Script.
